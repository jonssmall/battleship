TypeScript battleship game

Underlying game engine more-or-less complete. Want to revisit the weird reciprocal dependency where each player's board requires the other player as an argument. Not my finest OOP hour.

Naive AI console game complete. Usually takes checking nearly the entire board to win.

Todo: 
1. Single player offline app.
2. Multiplayer websocket app.
